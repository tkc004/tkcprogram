This directory contains two main major programs: dmalpha.py to find slope of a DM profile and plot them against observations (see Chan+2017 for more details).

Before running the python program, we need to set the python library path such that it links to the correct tools:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:'program directory'/tkcprogram/tools/, where program directory is the location or tkcprogram.
We also need scripy, numpy, matplotlib, os, etc for the code to work.

To load a snpashot file (in hdf5 format), we need to modify the info in cosmichalo, esp 'maindir', 'rundir', & 'subdir'. Your hdf5 file should be at 'maindir'/'rundir'/'subdir'.

We also need the information from AHF and/or MergerTree, which should be available on stampede FIRE folder (for my runs), e.g. Pep and halos folders. We should put them in 'maindir'/'rundir'

Finally, modify the programdir in dmalpha.py.

After the above preparations, we can compile dmalpha.py and get plots in figures directory and data in outputdata.
